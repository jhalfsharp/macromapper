_NOTE: Macromapper is still a work in progress. The 1.0 release will mark when I think it's a useable app._
_At the moment, the app is little more than a tech demo or a proof of concept._

Macromapper is intended to be a simple mapping utility primarily for dungeon crawls in tabletop RPGs, such as Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder. I believe that, when drawing a map, you shouldn't have to sweat the little stuff - shading, grid, detailing, etc.

## What Macromapper's goals are

-   Good-looking, useful default style
-   Simple editing of large-scale layout
-   User convenience
-   Free, forever

## What Macromapper's goals are not

-   Intricate detailing and art tools
-   VTT integration
-   System-specific tools (i.e. stat blocks, prebuilt monsters)
